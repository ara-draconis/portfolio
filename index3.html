  <div class="desc">
    <p>
      I find my favorite thing in graphic design is that it allows me to relax
      into a a comfortable state of creation and expression. I’ve worked within
      many fields of artistry, from sculpting to painting, but have found, each
      time, that I work most comfortably within the design field. Having worked
      so extensively with design, I have also found myself growing within the
      field and gaining a better understanding of the design process.
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel I am well suited to the field, as, along with my comfortability and
      familiarity with design, I possess originality and creativity that lends
      itself well to my work. My experience within other fields has also allowed
      me to branch out the ways in which I experiment within my design work, and
      allows for more unique pieces. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve been working with graphic design since high-school, and have studied
      extensively from then into my college career. The courses I’ve taken have
      allowed me to expand my thinking on design principles as well as learn
      more about the field and its inner workings. I’ve also had the opportunity
      within these years to work within the field on projects from logos to
      flyers. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My knowledge and experience within other art fields has also allowed me to
      accrue a diverse portfolio of works. The pieces within my portfolio
      showcase my large expanse of knowledge both in design and in the art field
      in general. The showcased works come from  the many fields I’ve learned
      over the years, including digital and physical illustration, painting,
      motion design, and, of course, graphic design. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal in the end is to become a designer that can be counted on for
      unique and intriguing designs. I plan to graduate and take my experience
      education and into the working world. I wish to stand out within the
      industry for my own personal style and technique. I find that the world of
      design offers many stimulating challenges and I wish to work with and
      within it for a long time to come.
