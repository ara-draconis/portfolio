        <p>Hello! My name is Ara~</p>

        <p>
          My main work consists usually of digital work, and I have about 5 years of graphic design experience. I enjoy and specialize in color and practice creating unique and cohesive color palettes that can be pleasing to any and all viewers.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main area of focus is on iconography and logo design, but I also work in many other areas of design, such as typography, image design, motion design, publication design, and web design. I make sure to practice in these fields individually, as well as opportunistically using them in tandem with each other to elevate any of my projects that I feel could need it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve also worked extensively with illustration, photography, and animation. While I do focus on graphic design, I’ve has also branched out to learn many other art and design forms, such as 2d animation, 3d modeling, digital and physical drawing/painting, and even writing. Overall, I’ve worked with many softwares, artistic styles, mediums, and art forms. I use all of these learned and practiced skills together to create designs with great originality and cleanliness.
